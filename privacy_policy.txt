Privacy Policy for Tapitap
Last Updated: November 5, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices for the mobile application "Tapitap" (hereinafter referred to as "the App"), developed for Android devices.

1. Information We Collect

We are committed to protecting your privacy. The App is designed to minimize data collection. The information we collect is solely for the purpose of providing and improving the core functionality of the service.

We collect the following information:

In-App Purchase Data: When you make a purchase within the App, the transaction is processed by the Google Play Store. We do not collect or store your payment information (such as credit card details). We only receive information from Google about the purchase (e.g., which collection was purchased and the transaction time) to enable access to your purchased content. Please review Google's Privacy Policy for information on how they handle your data.
Device Information for Functionality: To provide you with wallpapers from our server, the App automatically collects non-personally identifying information that your device sends whenever you use the App. This may include your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, device type, and operating system version. This data is used solely for the technical delivery of the wallpapers and basic service analytics (e.g., to monitor server load).
2. How We Use Your Information

The limited information we collect is used for the following purposes:

To download and display wallpaper images from our server to your device.
To verify and manage your access to purchased wallpaper collections via Google Play's In-App Billing system.
To ensure the stable operation and performance of the App and our server.
3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties, except in the following cases:

Service Providers: We rely on Google Play Services to process In-App Purchases. Their use of your data is governed by their own privacy policies.
Legal Requirements: We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.
4. Data Storage and Security

Wallpaper images are cached temporarily on your device to improve performance. The minimal data we collect (purchase records, IP addresses) is stored on our secure servers only for as long as necessary to provide the service and for legitimate business purposes.

5. Your Rights

You have the right to know what data we hold about you. Since we collect minimal data, this would typically relate to your purchase history. If you wish to inquire about this, please contact us using the details below.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
